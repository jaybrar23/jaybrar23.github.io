      <h1>Jay's list</h1>
      <p>Information technology is an evolving field with a large number of subfields such as networking, scripting, making websites, and many others. While we need different books for each of these fields, there are some books that should be read by everyone. I made this website for one purpose; to compile a list of books that will be helpful to IT students as well as professionals. For now, the website only contains books that I think are helpful but with feedback and suggestions from users like you, new books will be added too.</p>
      <p>So far, the list consists of only nine books but more books will be added soon. Signup to our newsletter and we will email you whenever a new book is added. Head down to our books section to read about the books, give your reccomendation or read reccomendation from the community.</p>
