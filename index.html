      <h1>Jay's website</h1>
      <p>Hey guys! I made this simple static html website for a university assignment. I am not a web developer so it's not that great but I spent around 5 hours on it so I thought, instead of letting it sit in a folder somewhere in my old laptop, I should repourpose it to write about who I am and what I have been doing in my university. Aside from this page, I have two more pages, one with my CV and the second one which has some projects and ssignments I did in uni.</p>
